I'm super excited to announce the first public version of [Tuxedo](https://tevelee.github.io/Tuxedo)! ðŸŽ‰

**Tuxedo** is a template language for Swift. It allows you to separate the UI and rendering layer of your application from the business logic. Smart templates working with raw data allow the frontend to be handled and developed separately from other parts of the application, so processing, layouting and formatting your output can be defined in very simple template formats.

Why the name? It dresses up your static output with elegant dynamic templates, using control statements, and high level operators.

The project comes with a set of built-in [data types](https://tevelee.github.io/Tuxedo/docs/data-types.html), [tags](https://tevelee.github.io/Tuxedo/docs/tags.html) and [functions](https://tevelee.github.io/Tuxedo/docs/functions.html) which makes this library amazing! Make sure to check out the [documentation](https://tevelee.github.io/Tuxedo) and [the GitHub project](https://github.com/tevelee/Tuxedo) to learn more about the library!

There is also a fair amount of work put into under-the-hood additions, such as a Continous Integration pipeline (also written in Swift), an awesome documentation page (this one ðŸ˜œ) using Docusaurus, a comprehensive unit and component test-target which provides >95% line coverage, and also a lot of additions added to [Eval](https://github.com/tevelee/Eval) framework (which is a lightweight and generic interpreter, that this project was build upon) to make this all happen.

Put a star on it on [GitHub](https://github.com/tevelee/Tuxedo) if you like it and join [our community](https://github.com/tevelee/Tuxedo/stargazers)! ðŸŽ‰
